# Quantum Bookstore

A simple Java project that simulates a small bookstore system with support for physical books, digital books, and showcase items. The project demonstrates clean object-oriented design using inheritance, service abstraction, and custom exception handling.

This was developed as part of an internship challenge to showcase practical design choices and good programming habits.

## Features

- Add and manage different types of books:
  - Paper books with limited stock and shipping simulation
  - EBooks that are delivered via email
  - Showcase books that are for display only and not for sale

- Purchase logic that:
  - Checks stock availability
  - Sends confirmation through simulated services (email/shipping)
  - Handles failure cases with meaningful feedback

- Inventory tools for:
  - Adding books
  - Removing outdated entries based on book age

- Exception handling with clear custom errors for better maintainability
